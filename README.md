# proj_euler
problems from project euler 
will be working through as many as I can in python probably. 
might make some java or c++ solutions as well later on

***
Theses are by no means ideal solutions, I'm essentially just trying to get working solutions as I go and then will try
to optimize them later on. Just for something to do while I'm on vacation to keep my brain working on something.
